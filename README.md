This Canister code allows you to use a custom signature verification method  
to grant the frontend a Delegation Identity verified by the InternetComputer Blockchain (similar to InternetIdentity).
Function:
You can create a Principal in a customized manner and bind this Principal with   
the session key generated by the frontend. By modifying the verification signature method,  
you can allow any wallet to sign and interact with the InternetComputer.
(In simple terms, by interacting with this Canister and obtaining a DelegationIdentity,  
any third-party wallet can interact with the InternetComputer!)
This project is for instructional use. Developers can modify the code themselves to better adapt it to their projects.  
You can use [js-sdk](https://github.com/Shuaige1234567/CustomDelegation-js-sdk) as a JavaScript npm dependency to interact with custom delegation canister.
